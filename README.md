# SURE USAGE MONITOR

Small Rails application to manage multiple broadband package accounts in the Falkland Islands.

Thus far I worked on producing an improved interface for the current usage portal and provide a way for users to have a simple dashboard to control multiple accounts.

## Gems

To produce this app I used the following gems:

* `devise` for authentication
* `chartkick` for the charts, I plan to use this far more in the future
* `fomantic-ui` for styling and layout

... and that's it. Hopefully I will not be using anything else.

## Roadmap

* Ability to store usage data to produce meaningful charts.

* SMS alerts with Twilio

* Multi-user email alerts

* Database creation

* Daily usage and 'off-hours' usage including upload

* Improved speed when handling multiple accounts
